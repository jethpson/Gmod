# Garry's mod,

is a sandbox game that provides players with an open-ended and creative gaming experience. Developed by Facepunch Studios, Garry's Mod was initially released as a modification for Valve Corporation's Source engine but later evolved into a standalone title. It offers a unique blend of game mechanics, allowing players to manipulate objects, create scenarios, and engage in a wide variety of activities within a virtual world.

One of the standout features of Garry's Mod is its extensive toolset. The game provides players with a range of tools that allow them to manipulate objects, create contraptions, and even script custom game modes.

Expression 2, often abbreviated as E2, is a scripting language and system used within Garry's Mod. Specifically designed for the Wiremod add-on, Expression 2 provides GMod players with a powerful and flexible tool to create custom scripts and automate various in-game processes.

Expression 2 supports a variety of mathematical operations, making it well-suited for calculations and dynamic interactions. Users can perform arithmetic, trigonometric, and logical operations to manipulate values within their scripts.

The language includes control flow structures such as loops and conditional statements, allowing for the creation of more complex and dynamic scripts. This facilitates decision-making processes and iterative actions in response to in-game events.

Expression 2 scripts can interface with and control a wide range of Wiremod devices. This integration enables players to build intricate contraptions, ranging from automated doors and elevators to elaborate logic puzzles and games.

Expression 2 benefits from a vibrant and creative community. Users share their scripts and creations, contributing to a diverse library of resources available through the Steam Workshop.
